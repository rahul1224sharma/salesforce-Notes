# Chatter
- Chatter is a Salesforce collaboration application that lets your users work together, talk to each other, and share information, all in real time.
- Chatter connects, engages, and motivates users to work efficiently across the organization, regardless of role or location.
- Chatter lets users collaborate on sales opportunities, service cases, campaigns, and projects with embedded apps and custom actions.

## Profiles
- Everyone in your organization has a Chatter profile that they can customize with a photo, contact information, and a personal overview.

## Groups
- Groups are the main collaboration space in Chatter where people organize around a shared interest, purpose, or goal. People use their groups to share information, post updates, and ask questions.

## Follow Users, Groups, and Records
- Following is a way to identify the people and records you want to keep track of. When users follow people and records, they see updates from those people and records in their What I Follow feed. For example, when users join a group, they see updates that are posted to the group in their What I Follow feed.

## Email Notifications
- When you turn on email notifications for Chatter, users automatically receive emails about new posts, comments, and other changes.

## Feeds
- When your users follow people and records, they see posts, comments, and updates about them in their Chatter feeds.
- Chatter feeds appear on profile and group pages, the Home tab, topic pages, and on record pages.

## Topics (aka Hashtags)
- Topics give users a way to add searchable terms to their feed posts. Topics are great for adding to an ongoing discussion that is independent of a particular group. For example, your users can add the topic #newtech to many different posts in many different feeds. When any user searches for `#newtech`, their search results include all posts marked with that topic from all feeds the user has access to.

## Feed Tracking
- Feed tracking in Salesforce highlights changes to records by automatically announcing them in the recordâ€™s feed.

## Actions
- Actions add functionality, like post, poll, and question, to the Chatter publisher. Actions let your users do more in Salesforce and the Salesforce app.

## Approvals
- An approval process is an automated process your organization can use to approve records in Salesforce. It specifies the steps necessary for a record to be approved and who must provide approval at each step. The approval process can send out an approval request as a Chatter post.
