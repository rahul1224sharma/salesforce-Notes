# What is Salesforce?
- Salesforce is a customer success platform designed to help you sell, service, market, analyze, and connect with customers.
- Salesforce has everything you need to run your business from anywhere. Using standard products and features, you can manage relationships with prospects and customers, collaborate and engage with employees and partners, and store your data securely in the cloud.

## Salesforce Data
- Salesforce organizes data into `Objects` and `Records`.

### Objects
- Similar to tabs in a spreadsheet (e.g. Account, Contacts, Quotes)

### Records
- Similar to rows in spreadsheet tabs (e.g. Account Name, Phone, Website, Industry)

---

## Salesforce Standard Objects
- Objects that Salesforce already comes set up with and ready for use.
- Accounts, Contacts, Leads, Opportunities

### Accounts
- Companies you’re doing business with. You can also do business with individual people, like solo contractors, using Person Accounts. More on that later.

### Contacts
- People who work at a company you’re doing business with (Accounts).

### Leads
- Potential prospects who are not yet ready to buy or you haven't determined what product they need.
- You don't have to use Leads, but they can be helpful if you have team selling, or if you have different sales processes for prospects and qualified buyers.

### Opportunities
- Qualified leads that you’ve converted. When you convert a lead, you create an Account and Contact along with the Opportunity.
