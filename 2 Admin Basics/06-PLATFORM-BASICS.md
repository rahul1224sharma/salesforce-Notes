# Salesforce Platform Basics
- Salesforce is more than just a CRM.
- Salesforce comes with a lot of standard functionality, or out-of-the-box products and features that you can use to run your business. Here are some common things businesses want to do with Salesforce and the features we give you that support those activities.

## App
- An app in Salesforce is a set of objects, fields, and other functionality that supports a business process.
- You can see which app youâ€™re using and switch between apps using the `App Launcher`.

## Objects
- Objects are tables in the Salesforce database that store a particular kind of information.
- There are standard objects like Accounts and Contacts and custom objects like the Property object you see in the graphic.

## Records
- Records are rows in object database tables.
- Records are the actual data associated with an object. Here, the 211 Charles Street property is a record.

## Fields
- Fields are columns in object database tables.
- Both standard and custom objects have fields. On our Property object, we have fields like Address and Price.
