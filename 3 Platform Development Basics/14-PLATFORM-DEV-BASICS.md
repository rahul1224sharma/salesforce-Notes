## Reference
- [Platform Development Basics](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trails/force_com_dev_beginner/modules/platform_dev_basics)

## Salesforce Platform
- Like any platform, the Salesforce platform is a group of technologies that supports the development of other technologies on top of it. What makes it unique is that the platform supports not only all the Salesforce clouds, but it also supports custom functionality built by our customers and partners. This functionality ranges from simple page layouts to full-scale applications.

## Core Platform
- The core platform lets you develop custom data models and applications for desktop and mobile. And with the platform behind your development, you can build robust systems at a rapid pace.

## Heroku Platform
- Heroku gives developers the power to build highly scalable web apps and back-end services using Python, Ruby, Go, and more. It also provides database tools to sync seamlessly with data from Salesforce.

## Salesforce APIs
- These let developers integrate and connect all their enterprise data, networks, and identity information.

## Mobile SDK
- The Mobile SDK is a suite of technologies that lets you build native, HTML5, and hybrid apps that have the same reliability and security as the Salesforce app.

## Metadata-driven development model
- the key differences between developing on the platform and developing outside of Salesforce. Because the platform is metadata-aware, it can auto-generate a significant part of your user experience for you.
- Things like dialogs, record lists, detail views, and forms that you’d normally have to develop by yourself come for free.
- You even get all the functionality to create, read, update, and delete (affectionately referred to as CRUD) custom object records in the database.

## Lightning Component Framework
- A UI development framework similar to AngularJS or React.

## Apex
- Salesforce’s proprietary programming language with Java-like syntax.

## Visualforce
- A markup language that lets you create custom Salesforce pages with code that looks a lot like HTML, and optionally can use a powerful combination of Apex and JavaScript.
